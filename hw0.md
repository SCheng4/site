## Assigment 0

[This handout](handout1.pdf) shows a parallel corpus
between two alien languages. You'll use this data to translate some
alien words and sentences.

1. Try to draw lines between the words that are translations of each
other. Start out by finding words that occur in multiple source sentences,
like "ghirok", and see if you can find words that appear in all of the
corresponding target sentences. Do you notice any patterns in how the
words translate? Do you think that the prefix "ok-" corresponds to something?
*You do not have to turn anything in for this step.*

2. [This file](hw0_input.txt) contains some words and sentences,
one per line. Write a text file with your translations. Name this file
assignment0.txt and upload it to the base URL that you sent to Jonny.
