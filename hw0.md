Homework setup
=============================================================

In this course, there will be three projects. Your work on the
projects will be managed through the class github repository.

## Assignment0

In order to setup the homework environment, please do the following:

1. Sign up for our
   [Piazza course](http://www.piazza.com/hmc/spring2015/cs159). Make a
   post in the Introductions section telling us a little about
   you. What year and major are you? Why are you taking NLP? What do
   you hope to get out of this class? How do you learn best?

2. Sign up for a Language in Ten slot by following the
   [link on the presentation page](lin10.html).

2. Fork the setup repository to your computer (or one of the CS computers)

3. [This handout](handout1.pdf) shows a parallel corpus
between two alien languages. You'll use this data to translate some
alien words and sentences. Try to draw lines between the words that are translations of each
other. Start out by finding words that occur in multiple source sentences,
like "ghirok", and see if you can find words that appear in all of the
corresponding target sentences. Do you notice any patterns in how the
words translate? Do you think that the prefix "ok-" corresponds to something?
*You do not have to turn anything in for this step.*

4. [This file](hw0_input.txt) contains some words and sentences,
one per line. Put your translations in your asignment0.txt and push
the updates to your repository.

5. Submit a pull request to turn in your assignment.
