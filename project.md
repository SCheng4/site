Final Project <span class="text-muted">The Ultimate Challenge</span>
=============================================================

Your final project is to design a homework assignment for next yearâ€™s class.  You project should have the following components:
1. A description of the problem, similar to the descriptions on the HW assignments
1. A collection of data used to train a model, tune its parameters, and/or evaluate its performance
1. An objective function that will allow us to score submissions on the leaderboard
1. An implementation of the simplest possible baseline
1. An implementation of a published baseline
1. Additional extensions that attempt improve on the baseline, along with a 1 paragraph writeup describing each extension and whether it worked.
The number of additional extensions depends on the number of people in your group, and whether you are a graduate or an undergrad.

You should identify what topic you would like to work on, and schedule a meeting with your instructor to go over the details.  Here are some ideas of topics that you could use for your final project: 

* Sentence alignment
* Language identification
* Transliteration
* Feature engineering for discriminative word alignment
* Language modelling
* Phrase pair extraction
* SCFG rule extraction
* Implement the CKY algorithm for decoding SCFGs
* Domain adaptation
* System combination
* Mining parallel documents from Common Crawl
* Extracting parallel sentences from Wikipedia
* Monolingual text-to-text generation 
* Predicting the goodness of translation without references
* Crowdsourcing translation
* Minimum Bayes risk re-ranking

You are welcome to choose your own topic, provided that it is related to machine translation.

Details TBD.
